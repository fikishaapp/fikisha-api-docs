# Authentication

The Fikisha Vendor API uses API key authentication to secure all requests. This guide explains how to obtain and use your API credentials.

## Obtaining API Credentials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign In">
    Log in to your [Vendor Dashboard](https://vendor.fikisha.app/dashboard).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Settings">
    Go to the "API Credentials" section in your dashboard settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate API Key">
    Click "Generate New API Key" to create a new set of credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Credentials">
    Store your **Vendor ID** and **API Key** securely. The API Key will only be shown once!
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Your API Key is sensitive information. Never share it publicly or commit it to version control. If you suspect your API Key has been compromised, immediately generate a new one from the dashboard.
</Info>

## Using API Credentials

All API requests must include your credentials in the HTTP headers:

```http
X-Vendor-ID: YOUR_VENDOR_ID_HERE
X-API-Key: YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_HERE
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.fikisha.app/v1/sales \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Vendor-ID: YOUR_VENDOR_ID_HERE" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "type": "airtime",
    "amount": 10,
    "phoneNumber": "+254712345678",
    "provider": "safaricom"
  }'
```

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "unauthorized",
    "message": "Invalid or missing API credentials"
  }
}
```

Common authentication errors include:

- Missing API credentials
- Invalid Vendor ID
- Invalid API Key
- Expired API Key

<Info>
  If you receive authentication errors, double-check your credentials and ensure they're being sent in the correct headers. If problems persist, contact [support@fikisha.app](mailto:support@fikisha.app).
