# Authentication

Securing access to the Fikisha Vendor system is crucial. Authentication methods differ based on how you interact:

1.  **API Key Authentication (Primary for Integrators):** Used for **server-to-server** calls to specific Fikisha **HTTP Endpoints**. This is the method you'll use for building backend integrations, automations, or custom tools that interact directly with the API.
2.  **Firebase Authentication (for Fikisha Apps):** Used internally by the official Fikisha Vendor App and Web Portal when logged-in vendors perform actions. This typically involves Firebase Callable Functions and is handled by the Firebase SDKs.

This guide focuses primarily on **API Key Authentication**.

## 1. API Key Authentication (for HTTP Endpoints)

This method is required when your server or system needs to make calls to Fikisha API endpoints (e.g., `POST /v1/sales/initiate`, `GET /v1/wallet/balance`).

**Credentials:**

You need two pieces of information, which you can generate and manage in the **API Credentials** section of the [Fikisha Vendor Portal Dashboard](https://vendor.fikisha.com/dashboard):

1.  **Vendor ID (`X-Vendor-ID`)**: Your unique public identifier as a Fikisha vendor.
2.  **API Key (`X-API-Key`)**: Your secret authentication token. **Treat this with the same security as a password.**

**Making Authenticated Requests:**

For every request to a secured HTTP endpoint, you **must** include both your Vendor ID and API Key in the HTTP headers.

```http
POST /v1/sales/initiate HTTP/1.1
Host: api.fikisha.app      # Replace with actual API host
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
X-Vendor-ID: vd_live_abcdef1234567890  # Your actual Vendor ID
X-API-Key: sk_live_zyxwvu9876543210    # Your actual Secret API Key

{
  "saleType": "direct_airtime",
  // ... other request data ...
}
```

<Warning>
  **API Key Security is Your Responsibility!**
  - **Never** embed your secret API Key directly in client-side code (web browsers, mobile apps).
  - Store API Keys securely on your server using environment variables, secrets management services (like Google Secret Manager, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault), or secure configuration files with restricted access.
  - **Regenerate Immediately:** If you suspect your API key has been compromised, regenerate a new one *immediately* via the Vendor Portal. Update your applications accordingly, as the old key will be deactivated.
</Warning>

**API Key Authentication Errors:**

If your API Key or Vendor ID is missing, invalid, or deactivated, the API endpoint will typically respond with:

HTTP Status Code: 401 Unauthorized

Response Body:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Authentication failed: Invalid API Key.", // Or similar specific message
  "code": "unauthenticated"
}
```

## 2. Firebase Authentication (for Client Apps & Callable Functions)

This method applies when using the official Fikisha Vendor mobile app or web portal, or if you are building a client application that directly calls Fikisha's Firebase Callable Functions using the Firebase SDKs.

**How it Works:**

- Vendors log in to the app/portal using Firebase Authentication (e.g., Google Sign-In).
- When the app calls a backend Callable Function (like `initiateSaleRequest` when called from the app), the Firebase SDK automatically includes the logged-in user's ID token in the request headers.
- The backend function verifies this token to authenticate and authorize the vendor (`request.auth` context).
- No manual `X-Vendor-ID` or `X-API-Key` headers are needed for these SDK-based calls.

<Info>
  If you are building a server-side integration, you should use **API Key Authentication**. Firebase Authentication via SDKs is primarily for client-side applications interacting directly with Callable Functions provided by Fikisha.
</Info>

**Callable Function Authentication Errors:**

If a user is not properly authenticated when calling a callable function via the SDK, the SDK will throw an error, typically with `error.code` set to `functions/unauthenticated`. Your client application should handle this by prompting the user to log in. See Error Handling.

## Which Method Should You Use?

- **Integrating your backend server or an automated script with Fikisha?** Use API Key Authentication with HTTP Endpoints.
- **Building a client-side application (like a custom dashboard) that interacts with Fikisha's backend functions directly?** Use Firebase Authentication and call the Firebase Callable Functions via the SDK.
