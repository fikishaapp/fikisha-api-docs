# Authentication

All requests to the Fikisha Vendor API require authentication. We use API keys to authenticate requests.

## API Keys

Your API credentials consist of:

- **Vendor ID**: Your unique vendor identifier
- **API Key**: Your secret key for authentication

Both these values must be included in the header of every API request.

```bash
X-Vendor-ID: your-vendor-id
X-API-Key: your-api-key
```

## Generating API Keys

You can generate your API keys from the [Fikisha Vendor Dashboard](https://vendor.fikisha.com/api-integration). If you need to regenerate your API key at any time, you can do so from the dashboard.

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure! Do not share it in publicly accessible areas or client-side code.
</Warning>

## Authentication Errors

If your authentication credentials are invalid or missing, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Authentication failed: Invalid API Key"
}
```
