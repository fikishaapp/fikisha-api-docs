# API Reference Overview

This section provides a comprehensive technical reference for all Fikisha Vendor HTTP API endpoints. These endpoints enable your backend services or automated tools to programmatically interact with the Fikisha platform for managing airtime, data bundles, contacts, campaigns, sales, and wallet information.

## Authentication

All HTTP API endpoints require authentication using your Vendor ID and API Key passed in the HTTP headers:

```plaintext
X-Vendor-ID: YOUR_VENDOR_ID_HERE
X-API-Key: YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_HERE
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Refer to the full Authentication Guide for details on generating keys and security best practices.
Base URL
All production HTTP API endpoints are accessed via the following base URL:

Common Request/Response Patterns
Request Format

All POST requests require a JSON body with the appropriate structure for the endpoint
All GET requests use query parameters for filtering and pagination
All requests must include the authentication headers

Response Format
All API responses follow a consistent structure:
Success Responses:
json{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data specific to the endpoint
  }
}
Error Responses:
json{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error Type",
  "message": "A human-readable description of the error."
}
Asynchronous Operations
Many operations in the Fikisha API are asynchronous, particularly those involving external providers:

You send a request to an endpoint (e.g., POST /sales, POST /airtime)
The API validates your request and responds with a status code (typically HTTP 200 OK) and transaction details
The final result is communicated via one of two methods:

Webhooks (recommended): Real-time notifications sent to your configured endpoint
Status Polling: Checking the status endpoint periodically using the ID returned in the initial response



Error Handling
Refer to the Error Handling Guide for detailed information on status codes, error structures, and handling strategies.
Rate Limiting
API endpoints have rate limits to ensure system stability. The API implements rate limiting with the following constraints:

Each endpoint is limited to 10 concurrent instances
Batch requests support up to 1 million requests per batch
Pagination is limited to 100 items per page

Exceeding these limits will result in an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response. Implement retry strategies with exponential backoff for optimal integration.
<Info>
  If you anticipate high-volume usage, contact Fikisha support to discuss adjusted rate limits for your integration.
