# Bulk Request Airtime Delivery

Submits multiple asynchronous airtime delivery requests (Direct or PIN) efficiently in a single HTTP API call. Each valid request within the batch is queued individually for processing. This endpoint requires API Key authentication.

<Warning>
  This endpoint is suitable for server-to-server integrations or automated batch processing. Ensure proper security and rate limit considerations. Check API limits (e.g., max 100-500 requests per call) with Fikisha support.
</Warning>

## Authentication

This endpoint requires **API Key Authentication**. Include your `X-Vendor-ID` and `X-API-Key` in the HTTP request headers.

```http
POST /v1/airtime/bulk HTTP/1.1
Host: api.fikisha.app # Replace with actual host
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
X-Vendor-ID: YOUR_VENDOR_ID_HERE
X-API-Key: YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_HERE

{ ... request body ... }
```

See the [Authentication Guide](/authentication) for details.

## Request Body

The request body contains an array of individual airtime requests.

<ParamField body="airtimeRequests" type="array" required>
  An array of objects, each representing a single airtime request.
  
  <Expandable>
    <ParamField body="saleType" type="string" required fixed="direct_airtime | pin_airtime">
      Specifies if it's a direct top-up (`"direct_airtime"`) or PIN generation (`"pin_airtime"`).
    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField body="phoneNumber" type="string" required>
      Recipient's phone number, including country code (e.g., `+254712345678`).
    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField body="amount" type="number" required>
      Airtime amount (KES). Must meet minimum requirements (e.g., > 5 KES).
    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField body="provider" type="string" required>
      Lowercase provider code (e.g., `safaricom`, `airtel`, `telkom`).
    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField body="clientRef" type="string">
      *(Optional)* Your unique reference for **this specific request** within the bulk call (max 50 characters). Highly recommended for tracking individual items.
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

```json
{
  "airtimeRequests": [
    {
      "saleType": "direct_airtime",
      "phoneNumber": "+254711111111",
      "amount": 50,
      "provider": "safaricom",
      "clientRef": "bulk-job-1-item-1"
    },
    {
      "saleType": "pin_airtime",
      "phoneNumber": "+254722222222", // For logging PIN request
      "amount": 100,
      "provider": "airtel",
      "clientRef": "bulk-job-1-item-2"
    },
    {
      "saleType": "direct_airtime",
      "phoneNumber": "+254733333333", // Example item that might fail validation
      "amount": 3, // Below minimum
      "provider": "safaricom",
      "clientRef": "bulk-job-1-item-3"
    }
    // ... up to the API limit
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  The total cost for the bulk request is calculated by summing the `amount` of all **valid** requests in the batch. This total cost is checked against your wallet balance before any requests are queued.
</Note>

## Response (202 Accepted or 4xx/5xx)

Success (202 Accepted): Indicates the bulk request was received, partially or fully validated, and valid individual requests have been queued. The response body details which requests were accepted and which failed initial validation.

Client/Server Errors (4xx/5xx): Indicates a problem with the overall request (e.g., authentication failure, malformed JSON, server error) before individual items could be processed.

Success Response Body (202 Accepted):

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean" required>
  Typically `true` if the bulk request itself was processed, even if some individual items failed validation. Check `validationErrors`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string" required>
  A summary message indicating how many requests were queued and how many failed validation (e.g., "Bulk request processed. 2 requests queued, 1 failed validation.").
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="requestIds" type="array" required>
  An array containing the unique `sale_request` IDs (`sale_req_...`) generated for each **valid and queued** request. The order corresponds to the valid items in the input `airtimeRequests` array. Use these IDs to track individual statuses.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="validationErrors" type="object | null" required>
  An object detailing initial validation failures.
  - **Key:** The zero-based index of the failed request in the original `airtimeRequests` array.
  - **Value:** A string describing the validation error (e.g., "Amount must be greater than 5.").
  - `null` if all requests passed initial validation.
  *(Requests listed here were **not** queued and **not** charged)*.
</ResponseField>

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Bulk request processed. 2 requests queued, 1 failed validation.",
  "requestIds": [
    "sale_req_abc...", // Corresponds to input index 0
    "sale_req_def..."  // Corresponds to input index 1
  ],
  "validationErrors": {
    "2": "Amount must be greater than 5." // Error for request at input index 2
  }
}
```

<Info>
  Each successfully queued airtime request (identified by its `requestId` in the response) is processed asynchronously. Use [Webhooks](/guides/webhooks) or Firestore listeners on `/transactions/{requestId}` (or equivalent status check endpoint) to track the final status (`completed` or `failed`) and retrieve PINs for each one.
</Info>

## Possible Errors (Synchronous)

Errors during the initial POST `/v1/airtime/bulk` request:

| HTTP Code | Error Code (code) | Description |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| 400 | invalid-argument | Invalid overall request structure (e.g., missing airtimeRequests array), exceeds bulk item limit, or contains structural JSON errors. Individual item validation errors are returned in the 202 response body. |
| 401 | unauthenticated | Missing or invalid X-Vendor-ID or X-API-Key. |
| 402 | insufficient-funds | Wallet balance is less than the total calculated cost of all initially valid requests in the batch. |
| 429 | rate-limit-exceeded | Bulk request rate limit exceeded. |
| 500 | internal | Server-side error during initial bulk validation or queueing. |

Refer to the [Error Handling Guide](/error-handling) for details.
