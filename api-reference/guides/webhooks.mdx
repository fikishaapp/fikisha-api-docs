# Webhooks (Asynchronous Results)

Many Fikisha Vendor API operations, particularly those initiated via the `POST /v1/sales/initiate` endpoint (for airtime, data bundles, physical goods), are processed **asynchronously**. Your initial API call might receive an `HTTP 202 Accepted` response, confirming the request is queued, but the final outcome (e.g., `completed` or `failed`) occurs later.

Webhooks are the recommended mechanism for receiving real-time notifications about the final status of these asynchronous operations. Fikisha will **push** updates to your designated server endpoint via HTTP POST requests as soon as a result is available.

## Why Use Webhooks?

-   **Real-time:** Get immediate notifications, enabling timely updates in your system or to your end-users.
-   **Efficiency:** Avoids the need for continuous polling of status endpoints, reducing load and complexity.
-   **Automation:** Trigger workflows based on transaction success (e.g., send confirmation SMS, update order status) or failure (e.g., notify admin, attempt refund logic).

## Setting Up Your Webhook Endpoint

<Warning>
  Webhook configuration through the Vendor Portal is planned but not yet available. Fikisha will provide details on setup and secret management when the feature is released. This guide describes the intended functionality.
</Warning>

1.  **Develop Your Listener:**
    *   Create a **secure (HTTPS)** HTTP POST endpoint on your server.
    *   This endpoint must be publicly accessible by Fikisha's servers.
    *   It must be capable of receiving and parsing `application/json` request bodies.

2.  **Configure URL (Future):**
    *   In the future, you will configure this HTTPS URL in the API Settings section of the [Fikisha Vendor Portal](https://vendor.fikisha.com/dashboard).
    *   You will likely also receive a **Webhook Signing Secret** during configuration for security verification.

3.  **Verification (Future):**
    *   Fikisha may send a test `ping` event or similar verification request upon setup. Your endpoint should respond promptly with a `200 OK` status to confirm reachability.

## Receiving Webhook Events

When an asynchronous operation initiated via the API (e.g., a sale request) reaches its final state, Fikisha will send an HTTP POST request to your configured webhook URL.

**Request Details:**

-   **Method:** `POST`
-   **Content-Type:** `application/json`
-   **(Future) Signature Header:** Expect a header like `Fikisha-Signature` containing a verifiable signature (details TBD).

**Webhook Payload Body:**

The JSON body provides details about the event and the related resource.

<ResponseField name="eventType" type="string" required>
  Identifies the event type. Examples:
  - `sale.request.completed`
  - `sale.request.failed`
  *(More types like `withdrawal.completed`, `withdrawal.failed` may be added)*
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="eventId" type="string" required>
  A unique ID for this specific webhook delivery. Crucial for **idempotency**.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="timestamp" type="string" required>
  ISO 8601 timestamp of when the event occurred within Fikisha's system.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="object" required>
  Contains the details of the Fikisha resource whose state changed.
  <Expandable>
      <ResponseField name="requestId" type="string" required>
        The **Sale Request ID** (`sale_req_...`) returned in the initial `202 Accepted` response from `POST /v1/sales/initiate`. Use this to correlate the event with your original request.
      </ResponseField>
      
      <ResponseField name="transactionId" type="string">
        *(Optional)* The final transaction document ID (`api_txn_...`, etc.) if applicable and different from the `requestId`.
      </ResponseField>
      
      <ResponseField name="clientRef" type="string">
        *(Optional)* Your unique reference string, echoed back if provided in the initial request.
      </ResponseField>
      
      <ResponseField name="status" type="string" required>
        The final status: `completed` or `failed`.
      </ResponseField>
      
      <ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
        The type of the original sale (e.g., `direct_airtime`, `data_bundle`).
      </ResponseField>
      
      <ResponseField name="amount" type="number" required>
        The amount involved.
      </ResponseField>
      
      <ResponseField name="phoneNumber" type="string">
        *(If applicable)* The target phone number.
      </ResponseField>
      
      <ResponseField name="provider" type="string">
        *(If applicable)* The network provider code.
      </ResponseField>
      
      <ResponseField name="pin" type="string">
        *(Applicable for `pin_airtime` on `completed` status)* The generated airtime PIN.
      </ResponseField>
      
      <ResponseField name="failureReason" type="string">
        *(Applicable if `status` is `failed`)* Description of the failure.
      </ResponseField>
      {/* Add other potential fields like productName, quantity, withdrawal details etc. */}
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

## Responding to Webhooks

**Acknowledge Receipt Immediately:**

Your webhook endpoint **must** respond very quickly (within 5-10 seconds) with an `HTTP 2xx` status code (e.g., `200 OK`, `204 No Content`) to confirm successful receipt.

<Important>
  **Avoid synchronous processing.** Do not perform time-consuming tasks (database updates, external calls) *before* sending the `2xx` response. If your endpoint times out or returns an error (`4xx`, `5xx`), Fikisha will assume the delivery failed and may retry, potentially causing duplicate processing if your logic isn't idempotent.
</Important>

**Handle Failures:**

-   If Fikisha retries delivery due to non-`2xx` responses from your end, your system needs to handle receiving the same `eventId` multiple times gracefully (see Idempotency below).
-   Log failures on your end to diagnose issues with your endpoint or processing logic.

## Security

-   **HTTPS Required:** Your webhook listener URL **must** use HTTPS. Fikisha will not send webhooks to insecure HTTP URLs.
-   **Signature Verification (Future - Crucial):**
    -   When available, you **must** verify the webhook signature included in the `Fikisha-Signature` header (or similar).
    -   Use the unique **Webhook Signing Secret** (provided securely via the Vendor Portal) along with the raw request body to compute the expected signature (likely using HMAC-SHA256).
    -   Compare the computed signature with the one in the header. **Reject any request where the signature does not match.** This prevents attackers from sending fake webhook events to your endpoint.
    -   *Detailed verification instructions will be provided when this feature is live.*

## Best Practices

1.  **Acknowledge Fast, Process Later:** Send `200 OK` immediately. Queue the received JSON payload using a reliable system (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, Google Cloud Tasks, Redis queue) for background processing.
2.  **Idempotency:** Use the `eventId` from the webhook payload. Before processing, check if you've already successfully processed an event with this `eventId`. If so, acknowledge with `200 OK` but skip the processing steps to prevent duplicates. Store processed `eventId`s temporarily (e.g., in Redis with an expiry, or a database table).
3.  **Use `requestId` / `clientRef`:** Match the webhook event data back to your internal records using the `requestId` (returned from the initial API call) or your `clientRef`.
4.  **Monitoring & Logging:** Implement robust logging for received webhooks (including headers and body), processing attempts, successes, and failures. Set up monitoring and alerts for your webhook endpoint's availability and error rates.
5.  **Error Handling (Your Processor):** Handle potential errors during your background processing gracefully (e.g., database connection issues). Implement retries within your processor for transient errors if appropriate.
