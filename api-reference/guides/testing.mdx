# Testing Your Integration

Thorough testing is critical before deploying any application that interacts with the Fikisha Vendor API, especially when dealing with real funds and transactions.

## Testing Environment

<Warning>
  **No Sandbox Available:** Fikisha currently does **not** provide a dedicated sandbox or test environment. All API calls made with valid production credentials interact directly with the **live** Fikisha system and affect your **live** vendor wallet. **Exercise extreme caution during testing.**
</Warning>

<Note>
  Documentation will be updated if/when a sandbox environment becomes available.
</Note>

We recommend simulating API responses in your own development environment where possible (see Mocking section below). When live testing is necessary, strictly adhere to the best practices outlined here.

## Testing Live API Endpoints

<Warning>
  Use live endpoints sparingly and with extreme caution. All transactions affect your live vendor wallet.
</Warning>

### Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="API Credentials">
    Use your **live** Vendor ID and API Key. Consider if generating a separate key *solely* for staging/testing environments within your system enhances security (if the portal allows multiple keys). Treat all keys as production secrets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Minimal Values">
    Initiate transactions (airtime, data) using the **smallest possible amounts** allowed by the API (e.g., 10 KES) to minimize financial impact during tests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Controlled Recipients">
    Use phone numbers you own or those belonging to informed colleagues for testing airtime/data delivery. **Do not** send unsolicited test transactions to actual customers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Low Wallet Balance">
    Maintain only a minimal balance in your vendor wallet, sufficient only for the small test transactions you plan to execute. Avoid large top-ups for testing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use `clientRef` Consistently">
    **Always** include a unique and identifiable `clientRef` (e.g., `test-svr-airtime-001`, `dev-data-xyz-timestamp`) in your `POST /v1/sales/initiate` requests. This is vital for:
    - Identifying test transactions in your server logs
    - Reconciling results received via webhooks or status checks
    - Assisting Fikisha support in tracing specific requests if issues occur
  </Step>
  <Step title="Isolate Test Logic">
    Ensure your testing scripts or environments are clearly distinct from your production deployment to prevent accidental live transactions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Specific Scenarios

Use tools like `cURL`, Postman, or HTTP libraries in your preferred language (`axios`, `requests`, etc.) to test these cases:

### Authentication (`401 Unauthorized`)

<CardGroup col={2}>
  <Card title="Missing Headers">
    Send requests without the `X-Vendor-ID` or `X-API-Key` header.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Invalid Credentials">
    Send requests with incorrect `X-Vendor-ID` or `X-API-Key`.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Input Validation (`400 Bad Request`)

<CardGroup col={2}>
  <Card title="Missing Fields">
    Omit required fields (`saleType`, `totalCost`, type-specific fields).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Invalid Data Types">
    Send invalid data types (e.g., string for `amount`).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Invalid Formats">
    Send invalid formats (e.g., bad `phoneNumber`).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Invalid Ranges">
    Send values outside allowed ranges (e.g., `amount` too low).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Other Common Scenarios

<CardGroup col={2}>
  <Card title="Wallet Balance (`402 Payment Required`)">
    Send a valid request where `totalCost` exceeds your current wallet balance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Resource Not Found (`404 Not Found`)">
    Use non-existent `bundleId` or `productId`, or call non-existent endpoints.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Precondition Failed (`412 Precondition Failed`)">
    Request `quantity` greater than available stock for physical goods.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Successful Requests">
    Test both synchronous (`200 OK`) and asynchronous (`202 Accepted`) responses.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Testing Asynchronous Results & Webhooks

The most critical part is verifying the end-to-end flow for asynchronous operations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Webhook Endpoint Setup">
    - Set up a publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint (use tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for local testing)
    - Configure this URL in the Fikisha Vendor Portal
    - Ensure it responds with `200 OK` *immediately* upon receiving a POST request
    - Log the full incoming webhook payload (headers and body)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Event Triggers">
    - Initiate sales using the API with your test numbers/products
    - Verify webhook payloads for both success and failure events
    - Confirm data accuracy in the payloads
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Idempotency">
    - Manually re-send a captured webhook payload
    - Verify duplicate detection using `eventId`
    - Ensure no double processing occurs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Endpoint Failures">
    - Temporarily make your webhook endpoint return `500` errors or timeouts
    - Observe Fikisha's retry behavior
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Mocking API Responses

When testing the parts of *your backend system* that call the Fikisha API:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use HTTP Mocking Libraries">
    Employ libraries appropriate for your language/framework:
    - `nock` for Node.js
    - `responses` or `unittest.mock` for Python
    - `WireMock` for Java
  </Step>
  <Step title="Simulate Responses">
    Configure mocks for different scenarios:
    - `202 Accepted` for successful sales initiation
    - `200 OK` for GET endpoints
    - Various error responses (`401`, `400`, `402`, `500`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Your Logic">
    Verify your system correctly handles:
    - Success responses
    - Error responses
    - Retry logic
    - State updates
    - Error logging
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter unexpected Fikisha API behavior or discrepancies during live testing:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Gather Information">
    Collect the following details:
    - Your **Vendor ID**
    - The **`requestId`** (from the `202 Accepted` response)
    - Your **`clientRef`** (if used)
    - **Timestamps**
    - The **full request payload**
    - The **full response** received (status code and body)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contact Support">
    Send an email to [support@fikisha.app](mailto:support@fikisha.app) with all the gathered information.
  </Step>
</Steps>
