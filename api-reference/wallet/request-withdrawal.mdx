## Withdrawal Processing

The withdrawal process follows these steps:

1. **Validation**: Initial validation of request parameters, withdrawal method, and wallet balance.
2. **Queuing**: Valid request is queued for processing by the payment system.
3. **Processing**: The payment system processes the withdrawal (timeframe varies by method).
4. **Completion/Failure**: The withdrawal is marked as completed or failed based on the payment system response.

<Info>
  Processing times vary by withdrawal method:
  - Mobile Money: Typically 1-30 minutes
  - Bank Transfer: 1-3 business days
</Info>

## Monitoring Withdrawal Status

The status of a withdrawal request can be monitored through:

1. **Webhooks (Recommended)**: Configure webhooks to receive `withdrawal.completed` or `withdrawal.failed` events.

2. **Status Polling**: Use the wallet transactions endpoint (`/v1/wallet/transactions`) with filtering to check the status of specific withdrawal transactions.
