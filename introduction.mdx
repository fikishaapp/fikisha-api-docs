# Fikisha Vendor API

Welcome! This documentation provides everything you need to integrate the Fikisha Vendor API into your backend applications or services. Empower your platform by programmatically managing digital products like airtime and data bundles, contact groups, campaigns, and more using secure HTTP requests.

## Who is this API for?

This API documentation focuses on **server-to-server integrations** and is designed for:

-   **Developers** building backend systems, kiosks, agency banking applications, or utility payment platforms that need to trigger Fikisha sales.
-   **Businesses** looking to automate airtime or data bundle distribution from their own servers.
-   **Fikisha Vendors** wanting to build custom backend tools or scripts that leverage their accounts.
-   **Marketing teams** creating and managing promotional campaigns through the API.

<Info>
  If you are building a client-side application (like the official Fikisha Vendor Mobile App or Web Portal), you will likely interact with the backend via **Firebase Callable Functions** using the Firebase SDKs, which handle user authentication automatically. This documentation primarily covers the **HTTP Endpoints** secured by API Keys.

## Core Capabilities (via API Endpoints)

Using the Fikisha Vendor API endpoints, your server can:

-   <Icon name="paper-plane" color="#F7924F" /> **Manage Airtime:** Create and track airtime transactions via the `/v1/airtime` endpoint.
-   <Icon name="wifi" color="#F7924F" /> **Manage Data Bundles:** Process mobile data bundles via the `/v1/mobiledata` endpoint.
-   <Icon name="address-book" color="#F7924F" /> **Manage Contacts:** Create contact groups and manage contacts with the `/v1/contact-groups` endpoints.
-   <Icon name="bullhorn" color="#F7924F" /> **Run Campaigns:** Create and monitor marketing campaigns with the `/v1/campaigns` endpoints.
-   <Icon name="cart-shopping" color="#F7924F" /> **Process Sales:** Manage sales operations with the `/v1/sales` endpoints.
-   <Icon name="clock-rotate-left" color="#F7924F" /> **Track Transactions:** Monitor all transactions using the `/v1/transactions` endpoints.
-   <Icon name="wallet" color="#F7924F" /> **Manage Wallet:** Check balance and transaction history via the `/v1/wallet` endpoints.
-   <Icon name="webhook" color="#F7924F" /> **Configure Webhooks:** Set up and monitor webhooks for real-time notifications.

## How it Works

1.  **Authentication:** Your server authenticates requests using your unique **Vendor ID** and secret **API Key** passed in HTTP headers.
2.  **Request Initiation:** You send `POST` or `GET` requests to specific Fikisha API endpoints (e.g., `/v1/airtime`, `/v1/wallet/balance`).
3.  **Asynchronous Processing:** For transaction operations, Fikisha validates your request and wallet balance, then queues the task. You receive an immediate response.
4.  **Status Updates:** The final outcome (`completed` or `failed`) is communicated asynchronously, ideally via [Webhooks](/guides/webhooks) configured to your server.

## Getting Started

Ready to integrate?

1.  **Create Account:** Sign up on the [Fikisha Vendor Portal](https://vendor.fikisha.app/signin).
2.  **Generate Credentials:** Obtain your **Vendor ID** and **API Key** from the [Vendor Dashboard](https://vendor.fikisha.app/dashboard) (API Credentials section). **Keep your API Key secret!**
3.  **Fund Wallet:** Ensure your vendor wallet has funds via the [Dashboard](https://vendor.fikisha.app/dashboard).
4.  **Follow the Quickstart:** Make your first API call using our [Quickstart Guide](/quickstart), which focuses on the HTTP endpoint approach.
