# Fikisha Vendor API

Welcome! This documentation provides everything you need to integrate the Fikisha Vendor API into your backend applications or services. Empower your platform by programmatically managing digital products like airtime and data bundles, contact groups, campaigns, and more using secure HTTP requests.

## Who is this API for?

This API documentation focuses on **server-to-server integrations** and is designed for:

<CardGroup col={2}>
  <Card title="Developers" icon="code">
    Building backend systems, kiosks, agency banking applications, or utility payment platforms that need to trigger Fikisha sales.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Businesses" icon="building">
    Looking to automate airtime or data bundle distribution from their own servers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fikisha Vendors" icon="store">
    Wanting to build custom backend tools or scripts that leverage their accounts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Marketing Teams" icon="bullhorn">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  If you are building a client-side application (like the official Fikisha Vendor Mobile App or Web Portal), you will likely interact with the backend via **Firebase Callable Functions** using the Firebase SDKs, which handle user authentication automatically. This documentation primarily covers the **HTTP Endpoints** secured by API Keys.

## Core Capabilities

Using the Fikisha Vendor API endpoints, your server can:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Manage Airtime">
    <Icon name="paper-plane" color="#F7924F" /> Create and track airtime transactions via the `/v1/airtime` endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Data Bundles">
    <Icon name="wifi" color="#F7924F" /> Process mobile data bundles via the `/v1/mobiledata` endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Contacts">
    <Icon name="address-book" color="#F7924F" /> Create contact groups and manage contacts with the `/v1/contact-groups` endpoints.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Campaigns">
    <Icon name="bullhorn" color="#F7924F" /> Create and monitor marketing campaigns with the `/v1/campaigns` endpoints.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Sales">
    <Icon name="cart-shopping" color="#F7924F" /> Manage sales operations with the `/v1/sales` endpoints.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track Transactions">
    <Icon name="clock-rotate-left" color="#F7924F" /> Monitor all transactions using the `/v1/transactions` endpoints.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Wallet">
    <Icon name="wallet" color="#F7924F" /> Check balance and transaction history via the `/v1/wallet` endpoints.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Webhooks">
    <Icon name="webhook" color="#F7924F" /> Set up and monitor webhooks for real-time notifications.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authentication">
    Your server authenticates requests using your unique **Vendor ID** and secret **API Key** passed in HTTP headers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Initiation">
    You send `POST` or `GET` requests to specific Fikisha API endpoints (e.g., `/v1/airtime`, `/v1/wallet/balance`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Asynchronous Processing">
    For transaction operations, Fikisha validates your request and wallet balance, then queues the task. You receive an immediate response.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Status Updates">
    The final outcome (`completed` or `failed`) is communicated asynchronously, ideally via [Webhooks](/guides/webhooks) configured to your server.
  </Step>
</Steps>
